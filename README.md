Virtual Vakil: Making Legal Help Simple and Accessible

In India, many people struggle to understand legal documents. From rental agreements to job offers, these papers are often full of complex language that only trained lawyers can fully grasp. Hiring legal help is costly and often out of reach for students, workers, and small business owners. This confusion and inaccessibility lead to poor decisions and legal troubles.

We wanted to change that. What if anyone could get clear legal understanding instantly, without needing to visit a lawyer?

That’s how Virtual Vakil was born.

Virtual Vakil is an AI-powered legal assistant that helps users understand legal documents and ask questions about Indian law in simple terms. Users can upload PDFs or images of contracts, and the system extracts key information, highlights important clauses, and explains everything clearly. There’s also a chatbot that responds to user queries like a virtual lawyer.

The backend is built using FastAPI and integrates PyMuPDF and Tesseract OCR for extracting text. We use the Gemini API to process and analyze the content, offering summaries and legal advice based on Indian law. The frontend is built with React and Vite, giving users a smooth and responsive experience.

This is an ongoing project. In future stages, we aim to train custom machine learning models using Indian legal data, case histories, and contract formats. The goal is to create a truly intelligent virtual vakil that not only explains but also advises, drafts, and flags risks like a real legal expert.

With Virtual Vakil, we hope to make legal understanding affordable, accessible, and empowering for everyone.
