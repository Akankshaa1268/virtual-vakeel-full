Virtual Vakil: Making Legal Help Simple and Accessible

In India, millions of people struggle to understand legal documents. From rental agreements to job contracts, these papers often contain complex terms that are hard to grasp without a legal background. Hiring a lawyer is expensive and time-consuming, and many people simply sign documents without fully understanding them. This can lead to serious problems later on.

We wanted to solve this. So we asked ourselves a simple question: What if every person could have access to a smart legal assistant right from their phone or laptop?

That’s how Virtual Vakil was born.

Our project is an AI-powered legal assistant that helps people understand documents and ask legal questions in plain language. Users can upload PDFs or images of documents, and the app will read them, extract key clauses, and explain the content clearly. They can also chat with an AI lawyer to get answers to common legal queries, all based on Indian law.

The backend is built with FastAPI and uses tools like PyMuPDF and Tesseract OCR to read text from documents. We then use Google’s Gemini API to analyze and summarize the content like a real lawyer. The frontend is built with React and Vite, offering a simple and user-friendly interface for uploading files and chatting.

With Virtual Vakil, our goal is to make legal understanding easy and free for everyone. Whether you are a student renting an apartment, a freelancer signing a contract, or a small business owner reviewing a deal, Virtual Vakil gives you the confidence to move forward with clarity.

This project is our way of combining technology with real-world impact. We hope it empowers people to make better legal decisions without fear or confusion.
